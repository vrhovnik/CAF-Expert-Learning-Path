# CAF Hackathon - Adopt: Migrate

**Challenge 1 - Whiteboard Design Session**

In this whiteboard design session, you will look at how to design an Azure migration for a heterogenous customer environment. The existing infrastructure comprises both Windows and Linux servers running on both VMWare and physical machines, and includes some legacy servers. Throughout the whiteboard design session, you will look at the various options and services available to migrate heterogenous environments to Azure.

At the end of this workshop, you will be better able to design and implement the discovery and assessment of environments to evaluate their readiness for migrating to Azure using services including Azure Migrate and Azure Database Migration Service.
