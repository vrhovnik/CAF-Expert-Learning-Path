## Welcome to the Cloud Adoption Expert Learning Path!

This learning path for Microsoft partners is aligned with Module A (aka "The Cloud Foundation") for Azure Advanced Specialization. This module evaluates the use of a consistent methodology and process for Azure adoption that is aligned with customers’ expected business outcomes, spanning the entire cloud adoption lifecycle.

Azure Advanced Specialization Module A covers these 5 pillars:

1. Strategy
2. Plan
3. Environment readiness and Azure landing zone
4. Governance
5. Manage

The learning path is based on the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure (CAF). It is guidance that's designed to help organizations create and implement business and technology strategies for the cloud. It provides best practices, documentation, and tools. Cloud architects, IT professionals, and business decision makers use this information to achieve their cloud adoption goals.


Having Cloud Adoption experts in a partner organization enables the partner to become a trusted advisor not only for their customers on their journey to the cloud, but also to Microsoft field teams. These “experts” continuously generate more value  with customers by leveraging CAF for Azure best practices, and help these customers' better align their business and technical strategies to ensure success.

## Prerequisites

### Please review the requirements including self-paced online courses, certifications, and Azure subscriptions for this learning path listed [here](https://github.com/jonathan-vella/CAF-Expert-Learning-Path/blob/main/agenda-and-requirements.md).

---

## Intro to the Cloud Adoption Framework

There are multiple sources to get a quick introduction into the Cloud Adoption Framework. There is a high-level learning path in [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/modules/microsoft-cloud-adoption-framework-for-azure/).
There is also an on-demand course in the [Microsoft Partner Network](https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/training/assets/collection/cloud-adoption-framework-for-microsoft-azure#/).

## The learning path

The learning path is based on an in-depth review of the Cloud Adoption Framework covering all pillars (as per Azure AS Module A requirements) plus three main modules with multiple hands-on activities in the form of labs, hackathons, and whiteboard desing sessions.

## Module 1: Define a Strategy & Build a Plan

### Hackathon Module 1

This CAF Hackathon enables attendees to understand and get familiar on how the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure (CAF) can be applied with their customers. This hackathon walks through the Define Strategy and Plan phases of the CAF to support attendees in leading a client engagement that is considering moving their digital assets to Azure.

By the end of the CAF Hackathon, attendees will have built a cloud adoption plan that they can use to present to a customer’s C-Suite to justify adopting the cloud. The purpose of this exercise is to provide you with the tools and understanding that will complement the conversations attendees may be having with their customers.

More info about this module is available [here](https://github.com/jonathan-vella/CAF-Expert-Learning-Path/blob/main/02-CAF%20Basic%20-%20Strategy%20and%20Plan/README.md).

## Module 2: Migrate Like A Pro

### Hackathon Module 2

In this workshop, you will learn how to design a migration strategy for on-premises environments to Azure, including the migration of virtual and physical services as well as databases.

At the end of this workshop, you will be better able to rationalize the migration of various workloads to Microsoft Azure as well as understanding how to determine the cost of hosting migrated workloads in Azure.

More info about this module is available [here](https://github.com/jonathan-vella/CAF-Expert-Learning-Path/blob/main/03-CAF%20Migrate%20-%20LoB%20Migration/README.md).

## Module 3: Azure Landing Zone Accelerator

### Hackathon Module 3

In this workshop, you will learn how the Azure landing zone accelerator enables your organization to make templatized landing zone deployments, with baked-in, repeatable best practices for governance, security, and compliance. It comes with a set of design principles for managing the platform at scale; these principles serve as a compass for subsequent design decisions across critical technical domains.

At the end of this workshop, you will be able to leverage the existing reference implementations, be able to build your own as well as understand how to establish policy-driven governance.

More info about this module is available [here](https://github.com/jonathan-vella/CAF-Expert-Learning-Path/blob/main/04-CAF%20Advanced%20-%20Landing%20Zones%20Accelerator/README.md).
